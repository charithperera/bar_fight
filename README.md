# WDI Project 3 - Team project
## Bar Fight by Charith, Chloe, Ka, Kerrie

#### A web app online game
Bar Fight is a fun, free-to-play, multiplayer online battle arena SPA game developed and published by Duck. Bar Fight is played in matches between two players, each with their own collection of battle cards. Players choose an Attack type from a selected card from their collection to battle opponents. The battle cards draw inspiration from the real life students of the WDI-9 class, bar-code.

### Lessons Learned

We worked very well as a team and communicted well throughout the project. We could have done more planning and been more specific about roles. We used Trello for our project management, detailing all broad tasks and this could have been used more to record all the smaller tasks as well. Overall we are happy with how the team performed and can see significant benefits to pair programming techniques.
