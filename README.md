# WDI Project 3 - Team project
## Bar Fight by Charith, Chloe, Ka, Kerrie

#### A web app online game
Bar Fight is a fun, free-to-play, multiplayer online battle arena SPA game developed and published by Duck. Bar Fight is played in matches between two players, each with their own collection of battle cards. Players choose an Attack type from a selected card from their collection to battle opponents. The battle cards draw inspiration from the real life students of the WDI-9 class, bar-code.
